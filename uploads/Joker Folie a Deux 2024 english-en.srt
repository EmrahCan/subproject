00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
commercial concert

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Gee him in his hand.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm there, huh?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, yeah, and then what part?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm facing Tr See

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Whoa.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I need to get heavy

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What the world needs now is love, sweet love is the only thing

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That is just to know what the world needs now

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It is love, sweet love, you know my death for so

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But for everyone, tell me about it

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well I don't need another mountain

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There are mountains and the inside is enough to cry

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There are oceans and rivers and not to cross

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Enough to last until the end of time

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What the world needs now is love, sweet love

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is the only thing that is just to know what the world needs now

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It is love, sweet love

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:37,000
TF

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, sorry.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nothing good about it.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Get out!

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, it's all right.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No, get out.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go, boys. Let's get this shoulder over.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get out of here.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Get out of here.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Get out of here.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We need to find a mess on him.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Get out of here.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Put your clothes on.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What the fuck?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You got a joke for me today?

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, let's go, guys.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Fuck.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fuck.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Fuck.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Get him out the ground.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Move this fucking ass!

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Move this fucking ass!

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Fuck you!

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Get the fuck out of here, Sam!

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Get out of here, boys!

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, it's been a crazy career, what?

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't make it down the mountain.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You got a big day today. You better put on a heavy face.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go, Arthur.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on, Fleck.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If only you're fancy lawyer, blame him and leave your late.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She knows what you like me, right?

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Take Fleck, you got a joke for us today?

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, it's been a while, hasn't it?

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's go!

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Back to fuck up, Kevin.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
From the line.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fleck, you.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Fleck, you got a joke for me.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Go.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All the kids done since he got here is fucking smile.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Today, all of a sudden he bites Moran.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because nobody likes Moran, he was a guy for a stay for like eight years before he got here.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's still a fucking tent.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fleck, you got a joke for us today?

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I already asked.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I got a joke for you.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why didn't you tell me the dog was Patrick?

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Clean yourself up.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You like that one, Arthur?

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why didn't you tell me the dog?

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why didn't you tell me the dog was a cat?

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why?

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The other half lives.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Could have been all yours if you hadn't killed Findings, no.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I love the show and it's portfolio.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm gonna get it.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Moira.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Come on.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jesus Christ, you couldn't get him a fucking umbrella.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Get her on there.

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Today we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Remember her.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She's gonna be videotaping you this time

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
so we can show it at your competency hearing next week.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And if they find you competent,
